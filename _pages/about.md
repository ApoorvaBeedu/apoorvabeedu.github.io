I am a PhD candidate advised by [Dr. Irfan Essa](http://www.irfanessa.gatech.edu/) and [Dr. Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My research interests are primarily focused on understanding the interconnectivity between actions and object's states, and have previously worked on the problem of 6D object pose estimation tasks.

In the summer of 2021, I was an intern at Facebook Reality Labs working with [Chengde Wan](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=bm5dZwIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Robert Wang](linkedin.com/in/rywang). In summer of 2020, I was an intern at Microsoft Research, working with [Dr. Amol Ambadekar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amol-ambardekar-2b745a14/). In the summer of '18 and '17, I interned at a startup called NodeIn, working with [Dr. Suresh Kannan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skkannan) 


I also have the pleasure of mentoring [Hyeongju John Choi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnc96) (2nd year MS@GT) in research projects.
